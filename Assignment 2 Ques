1. Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. s is already defined. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i',
'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5

Solution:
total = 0
for i in s:
    if i in 'aeiou':
        total += 1
print 'Number of vowels:', total


2. Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your 
program should print
Number of times bob occurs is: 2

Solution:
cnt = 0 
for i in range(len(s)): 
   if s[i:i+3] == 'bob': 
      cnt += 1 
print 'Number of times bob occurs is: ' + str(cnt)



3.  A catering company has hired you to help with organizing and preparing customer's orders. You are given a list of each customer's
desired items, and must write a program that will count the number of each items needed for the chefs to prepare. The items that a
customer can order are: salad, hamburger, and water.
Write a function called item_order that takes as input a string named order. The string contains only words for the items the customer
can order separated by one space. The function returns a string that counts the number of each item and consolidates them in the 
following order: salad:[# salad] hamburger:[# hambruger] water:[# water]
FOr example:
If order = "salad water hamburger salad hamburger" then the function returns "salad:2 hamburger:2 water:1"

Solution:

def item_order(order):
     salad = 0
     hamburger = 0
     water = 0
     for i in range(len(order)):
        if order[i:i+len('salad')] == "salad":  #Here i loops from i to i and add the length of salad in each i and check if it;s salad
          salad += 1       #If yes, then it adds 1 in salad.
        if order[i:i+len('hamburger')] == "hamburger":
          hamburger += 1
        if order[i:i+len('water')] == "water":
          water += 1
        
     return "salad:" + str(salad) + " hamburger:" + str(hamburger) + " water:" + str(water)
