1. Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. s is already defined. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i',
'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5

Solution:
total = 0
for i in s:
    if i in 'aeiou':
        total += 1
print 'Number of vowels:', total
