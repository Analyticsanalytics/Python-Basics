1)  Here * means import all the objects from the math module
from math import *

2) Then we can see list of all the objects that math has usng dir
print(dir(math))

3) We can also look at a particular in-built function of math using help
help(math.log)

4) By convention, variable names start with a lower-case letter, and Class names start with a capital letter.

5) If we try to use a variable that has not yet been defined we get an NameError:
type(y)  #We'll get the NameError since its no defined
y = 5
type(y) #It will give the output int


6)  A function in Python is defined using the keyword def, followed by a function name, a signature within parentheses (), and a
    colon :. The following code, with one additional level of indentation, is the function body.
def func0():   
    print("test")

7) we can define a so called "docstring", which is a description of the functions purpose and behaivor. The docstring should
   follow directly after the function definition, before the code in the function body.
def func1(s):
    """
    Print a string 's' and tell how many characters it has    
    """
    print(s + " has " + str(len(s)) + " characters")
